# E-Commerce System

This is a comprehensive and responsive e-commerce system implemented in C++ using vectors and other standard libraries. The system was developed as a second-year coding project, focusing on essential features for managing an online store.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with a default username and password.
- **Product Management**: Add, remove, and manage products in the store.
- **Cart System**: Users can add products to a cart and manage their purchases.
- **Order Processing**: Handle orders from users with real-time updates.
- **Data Persistence**: Use of input files to ensure initial data is loaded into the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Basic understanding of C++

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-system.git
   cd ecommerce-system
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**
   ```bash
   g++ -o ecommerce main.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the System**
   ```bash
   ./ecommerce
   ```

## Usage

### Initial Setup

- Run the provided input file (`data.txt`) to load initial data into the system.
- Alternatively, create your own input file in the same format.

### Login

- Use the following credentials to access the system:
  - **Username**: `Programmer`
  - **Password**: `123`

### Interact with the System

- **Product Management**: Add new products, update existing ones, or remove them from the system.
- **Cart and Orders**: Manage your shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and handle order processing.

## File Structure

- **main.cpp**: The main file containing the entry point and core logic of the system.
- **data.txt**: Sample input file to initialize the system with products and other data.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Customization

- Modify `data.txt` to include different products or user data for testing.
- Adjust the code in `main.cpp` to add new features or improve existing functionality.

## Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: Ensure the correct credentials are used (case-sensitive).
- **Data Loading**: Verify the format of `input before .txt` to ensure compatibility with the system.
